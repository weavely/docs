Weavely's powerful logic engine lets you dynamically control the flow of your forms and surveys. Whether you want to **skip pages**, **hide irrelevant questions**, or **only show certain elements based on previous answers**, Weavely makes it easy to build intelligent, responsive forms without writing code.

In this guide, we’ll walk through the basics of using **logic rules** in Weavely to create smarter form flows.

## Accessing the Logic Tab

Start by opening the form or survey you want to enhance. Once you're in the form editor, click on the **Logic** tab. This is where you’ll define all your conditional behavior.

Click **“Create Logic Rule”** to begin. Each logic rule follows an **IF → THEN** structure:

> _If certain conditions are met, then take a specific action._

## Example: Skip to Page

Let’s say you want to route a respondent to a different page based on how they answered a question.

For example:

- **Question:** How easy did you find it to navigate with the AI?
- **Condition:** If the answer is **“Very difficult”**
- **Action:** Skip directly to **Page 2**

## Hiding Pages

If you don’t want to just skip ahead but want to **completely remove a page from the flow**, use the **“Hide Page”** action instead.

This is useful when a specific set of questions becomes irrelevant based on earlier answers.

## Showing or Hiding Specific Elements

Logic rules aren’t limited to full pages, you can also show or hide **individual questions**.

For example:

- You might want to hide the question **“How intuitive was the interface?”** if a user answered negatively to a previous question.
- Or only show a follow-up question if the user answered **“Very easy.”**

Simply:

- Create a new logic rule.
- Choose **“Show Element”** or **“Hide Element”** as the action.
- Set your condition (e.g., a specific response to a previous question).

## Advanced Logic (Multiple Conditions and Actions)

Each logic rule can have:

- **Multiple conditions** (use “ANY” or “ALL” logic)
- **Multiple actions** (hide multiple questions, skip pages, etc.)

You can name your logic rules for clarity, and create **as many rules as needed** for one form. All active logic rules will work together to create a tailored, responsive experience for your respondents.
