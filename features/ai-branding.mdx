## How to Brand Your Form

1. **Create or open a form** in the Weavely editor

## What Gets Styled?

When you apply brand styling, the AI updates:

- **Colors** - Buttons, backgrounds, and accents
- **Fonts** - Headers and body text
- **Logo** - Automatically added to your form
- \*\*Banner visual - \*\*if detected on your website visuals are used for your form's banner
