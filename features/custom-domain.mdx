Weavely allows Pro users to share forms under their own custom domain, making it easy to create a branded and personalized form-sharing experience. Instead of sending out a generic `forms.weavely.ai` link, you can use a domain you own. For example, `feedback.yourcompany.com`.

## Step 1: Set Up Your CNAME Record

You'll first need to configure your DNS provider (e.g. GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.) to point your subdomain to Weavely.

Create a **CNAME record** with the following settings:

- **Name:** `feedback` (or whatever subdomain you chose)
- **Target:** `proxy.weavely.ai`

This will route traffic from your subdomain to Weavely’s servers.

Once that’s done, you'll need to finalise the setup inside of Weavely.

## Step 2: Add Your Custom Domain in Weavely

To get started, go to **Settings → Team Settings** in your Weavely dashboard. Scroll to the **Custom Domain** section.

Enter the domain or subdomain you'd like to use (e.g. `feedback.mycompany.com`) and press **Add Custom Domain**. Weavely will then check whether your DNS settings are correctly configured.

## Step 3: Share Forms Using Your Custom Domain

Once your custom domain is connected, you can begin using it to share your forms.

Just replace the default domain (`forms.weavely.ai`) with your custom one, keeping the form ID the same.

For example:

- Default: `https://forms.weavely.ai/abc123`
- Custom: `https://feedback.mycompany.com/abc123`

This gives your users a more seamless, branded experience.
