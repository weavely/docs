You can embed a PDF directly into your Weavely form, allowing users to view documents like product specs, guides, or legal disclaimers without leaving the form experience. This tutorial walks you through embedding a PDF from Google Drive and optimizing how it's displayed in your form.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NHA8ducXP5w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen />

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload the PDF to Google Drive" icon="file-doc" titleSize="h2">
    If you haven't already, upload your PDF to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com). Open the PDF by double-clicking and select \*\*"Open in new tab" \*\*from the three-dot menu. Within this new tab, click the three-dot menu (it's weird we know) and choose **"Embed item"**.

    Copy the HTML `<iframe>` code provided by Google, which we'll use in the next step.

    <Warning>
      Make sure the sharing permissions are set to **“Anyone with the link can view”**. Without this, the embed will not load in your form.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Embed in Weavely" icon="code" titleSize="h2">
    In your Weavely form, add an **Embed HTML** element. Open the element's settings pane and copy-paste the `<iframe>` code from the first step. Once published, your PDF will appear directly inside the form, and users can preview it without leaving the page. They can also click the pop-out button in the PDF viewer to open it full screen.

    <Tip>
      We suggest you set both the width and height in the `<iframe> `code to 100% to ensure it fills the container.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Improve the PDF Display" icon="palette" titleSize="h2">
    If the embedded PDF appears too small or scroll-heavy, you can adjust the layout. Go to the **Theme Editor** in Weavely. Under **Advanced Settings**, increase the **Form Width** to give the PDF more space and add the following **Custom CSS** to adjust the aspect ratio:

    ```css
    .embed-html {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
        background: var(--surface-color);
        overflow: auto;
    }
    ```
