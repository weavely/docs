## What Are PDF Reports?

PDF reports let you export your form responses as structured, formatted PDF files. When you download your results, Weavely generates an individual PDF for each form submission containing all questions and answers, laid out cleanly and ready to share.

This means you don't need to screenshot your results, copy data into a document, or use any third-party tools. One click and every form submission is saved as its own PDF.

## How to Download Form Responses as PDF

1. Open your form in the Weavely editor
2. Navigate to the **Results** tab
3. Press the **Download PDF** button
4. Weavely generates a ZIP file on the fly containing all your responses
5. Unzip the file, each form submission is its own individual PDF

That's it. No add-ons, no exporting to spreadsheets first, no print-to-PDF workarounds.

## What's Included in Each PDF

Every exported PDF contains:

- **Every question and answer** from the submission, structured and clearly formatted
- **The submission date and timestamp** so you know exactly when the form was filled in
- **Previews of signatures** if your form includes a signature field

## Exporting Multiple Responses

The Download PDF button exports all your form responses at once. If you have 50 or 100 submissions, the ZIP file will contain 50 or 100 individual PDFs: one per response. Each PDF includes the full submission data with its own timestamp.

## Customizing Your PDF Reports

The built-in PDF export gives you a clean, structured layout with basic formatting. If you need fully branded or customized PDF reports — with your own logo, colors, and layout — you can use integrations to create custom PDF templates from your form responses.

<Info>
  **Tip:** For fully branded PDF reports, check out integrations that allow you to design custom templates and automatically generate PDFs from each form submission. See [Integrations](/integrations) for available options.
