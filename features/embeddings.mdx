So you’ve crafted the perfect Weavely form and now you want to drop it into your website.  

Good news: it takes _two_ tiny snippets and about 90 seconds of effort,whether you want the form **embedded right in the page** or **popping up on cue**.  You'll find both options under the _Share_ tab while editing your form.

## Option 1: Embedded Form

**What is it:** The form lives _inside_ the page layout. Like a regular section, card, or sidebar.

**Why you'd use it:** Great for contact pages, product wait-lists, or anywhere you want the form to feel native to the flow of the content.

To embed a form into a website you'll need to complete two steps. First, paste the Weavely.ai _\<script\>_ into your website's _\<head\>_ section. Second, add the given \_\<div\> \_into your website. The position of this _\<div\>_ on your website will determine its location.

## Option 2: Popup Form

**What is it:** The form lives _inside_ the page layout. Like a regular section, card, or sidebar.

**Why you'd use it:** Great for contact pages, product wait-lists, or anywhere you want the form to feel native to the flow of the content.

Creating a popup form happens in three steps. First, paste the Weavely.ai _\<script\>_ into your website's _\<head\>_ section. Second, customise when and how the popup appears. Second, add the given \_\<div\> \_into your website. The position of this _\<div\>_ on your website will determine the popup's location.
