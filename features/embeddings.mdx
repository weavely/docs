So you’ve crafted the perfect Weavely form and now you want to drop it into your website.  

Good news: it takes _two_ tiny snippets and about 90 seconds of effort,whether you want the form **embedded right in the page** or **popping up on cue**.  You'll find both options under the _Share_ tab while editing your form.

## Option 1: Embedded Form

**What is it: **The form lives _inside_ the page layout. Like a regular section, card, or sidebar.

**Why you'd use it: **Great for contact pages, product wait-lists, or anywhere you want the form to feel native to the flow of the content.

To embed a form into a website you'll need to complete two steps.
