Weavely.ai makes it easy to create AI-generated quizzes that score user responses, display correct answers, and show live performance feedback. Here's how to set one up in minutes.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J3yls-Dcx_E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen />

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a Quiz with AI" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" titleSize="h2">
    To get started, head to [Weavely.ai](https://weavely.ai) and enter a prompt describing the quiz you need. For example:

    > "I need a quiz on European geography. Make it single page and just ask 4 questions."

    Weavely will automatically generate a basic quiz using AI, including multiple-choice and open-ended questions. You can customize the questions and look of the quiz from within the Weavely Editor. You can:

    - Add, delete, or modify questions.
    - Change the visual theme of your quiz (colors, fonts, layout).
    - Use drag-and-drop or AI styling to match your brand.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Quiz Mode" icon="toggle-large-on" titleSize="h2">
    Next you'll need to finalize the settings of your quiz. First, go to the **Settings** tab and **enable quiz mode.**

    ![Screenshot2025 10 20at21 34 29 Web](/images/Screenshot2025-10-20at21.34.29.webp)

    Second, for each question that requires it, you'll need to **assign a score** and specify **which answer is correct**. Without assigning a score, you won't be able to set correct answers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect and View Results" icon="database" titleSize="h2">
    The results tab will contain all individual responses given by your respondents as well as their  scores and number of correct answers. Furthermore, you can also set up integrations with third-party tools to automatically transfer your data. Read our [Google Sheets integration tutorial](/integrations/google-sheets) as an example.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and Share" icon="share-nodes" titleSize="h2">
    When you're ready, hit **Publish** and share your quiz as:

    - A standalone form (hosted on Weavely)
    - An embedded quiz on your site
    - A popup form on landing pages

    You can customize the domain and preview settings if needed. We have a dedicated tutorial on sharing which you can read [here](https://help.weavely.ai/get-started/sharing).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 💡 Tip 1: Dynamically Show Quiz Scores

You can show the respondents their scores (for example on the ending screen) using Weavely's variable system. Concretely, any textual component in Weavely (e.g. a paragraph or a heading) can show variables. By typing "@" you're given a dropdown menu with variables to choose from.

## 💡 Tip 2: Show Immediate Feedback

Do you want respondents to see if their answers were correct \_after each page? \_In **Settings**, enable **Show correct answers after each page**. This is especially useful for learning assessments or interactive quizzes.

## Example Use Cases

Typical use cases for our interactive quizzes include the following:

- Education and e-learning assessments
- Internal knowledge checks
- Trivia and gamified marketing content

Don't let that limit your imagination though 😉
