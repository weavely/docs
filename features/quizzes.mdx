Weavely.ai makes it easy to create AI-generated quizzes that score user responses, display correct answers, and even show live performance feedback. Here's how to set one up in minutes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a Quiz with AI" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    To get started, head to [Weavely.ai](https://weavely.ai) and enter a prompt describing the quiz you need. For example:

    > "I need a quiz on European geography. Make it single page and just ask 4 questions."

    Weavely will automatically generate a basic quiz using AI, including multiple-choice and open-ended questions. You can customize the questions and look of the quiz from within the Weavely Editor. You can:

    - Add, delete, or modify questions.
    - Change the visual theme of your quiz (colors, fonts, layout).
    - Use drag-and-drop or AI styling to match your brand.

  <Step title="Enable Quiz Mode" icon="toggle-large-on">
    TNext you'll need to finalise the settings of your quiz. First, go to the **Settings** tab and **enable quiz mode.**

    Second, for each question which requires it you need to **assign a score** and specify **which answer is correct**. Without assigning a score, you won't be able to set correct answers.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Preview the Quiz Experience

Once quiz mode is active:

- Respondents will receive a **final score** and see how many questions they answered correctly.
- You can also dynamically show this score on the **ending screen** using Weavely's variables:

  ```
  Your score: @{score} / @{max_score}  
  You got @{correct_answers} out of @{total_questions} correct.
  ```

## 5. Show Immediate Feedback (Optional)

If you want respondents to see if their answers were correct _after each page_:

- In **Settings**, enable **Show correct answers after each page**.
- This is especially useful for learning assessments or interactive quizzes.

## 6. Publish and Share

When you're ready, hit **Publish** and share your quiz as:

- A standalone form (hosted on Weavely)
- An embedded quiz on your site
- A popup form on landing pages

You can customize the domain and preview settings if needed.

## 7. Collect & Export Results

You can access full quiz results in the Weavely dashboard:

- View individual submissions, scores, and correct/incorrect answers.
- Export results as CSV for analysis.
- Or set up integrations with tools like **Google Sheets**, **Slack**, **Airtable**, and more.
