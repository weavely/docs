Weavely gives you two ways to customize your form design: styling individual forms or creating reusable themes for your entire account. This guide covers both methods so you can build professional, branded forms efficiently.

## Method 1: Styling Individual Forms

### Using AI to Style Your Form

The fastest way to customize your form design is by asking Weavely's AI to apply styling for you.

**Custom Colors**

Simply describe the colors you want in the chat. For example:

- "Make all the buttons black"
- "Use #FF5733 as the primary color"

The AI will instantly apply your color choices to the form.

**Brand Styling**

You can ask Weavely to automatically style your form based on any brand. Type something like:

- "Make this look like Coca-Cola"

The AI will prompt you for the brand's domain to confirm, then automatically fetch the logo, brand colors, fonts, and even banner images where available.

### Manual Styling Options

For more control over your form design, use the manual styling panel in the form editor.

**Pre-made Templates**

Choose from a selection of ready-to-use design templates to quickly apply professional styling to your form.

**Colors**

Customize your color palette by setting:

- **Background** color
- **Primary** color (for buttons and key elements)
- **Secondary** color (for text)

**Typography**

Select fonts that match your brand from the typography settings.

**Layout Options**

Choose how your form appears:

- **No visual** - Form only, no background image
- **Visual on left** - Background image on the left side
- **Visual on right** - Background image on the right side
- **Transparent form** - Form overlays the background

**Background Visuals**

Set your form's background in three ways:

1. **Search Unsplash** - Type a keyword (e.g., "forest") and Weavely will find a matching image
2. **Solid color** - Use a plain color background
3. **Upload custom image** - Use your own branded imagery

### Advanced Styling Features

Click the **Advanced** button to access additional customization options:

**Custom CSS**

Add your own CSS code for complete control over styling.

**Input Fields**

Choose your input field style:

- Rounded inputs
- Underlined inputs
- Square inputs

**Buttons**

Customize button appearance:

- Rounded corners
- Square corners
- Toggle animations on/off

**Form Layout**

Fine-tune your form's appearance:

- Adjust form width
- Control spacing between fields

**Logo Settings**

Add your company logo to the form:

1. Toggle **Show logo** on
2. Upload your logo file
3. Set the logo size

## Method 2: Creating Account-Wide Themes

If you're building multiple forms, you'll want to avoid styling each one individually. Account-wide themes let you create a design once and reuse it across all your forms.

### Accessing Theme Settings

From your dashboard:

1. Click on **Themes** in the navigation
2. Select **Create new theme**

### Creating a Theme

**Import Brand Styling**

Just like with individual forms, you can import branding from any website:

1. Enter the brand's domain (e.g., "coca-cola.com")
2. Click **Import**
3. Weavely fetches the logo, colors, and fonts

**Customize Your Theme**

Adjust the imported styling or create a custom theme from scratch:

- Set primary, secondary, and background colors
- Choose typography
- Configure layout preferences
- Add your logo

<Note>
  **Important:** When editing a theme, you're only setting the visual style, not the form content. There's no way to add specific questions or pages in theme settings.
</Note>

**Save Your Theme**

Give your theme a descriptive name (e.g., "Coca-Cola Theme" or "Company Brand") and save it.

### Setting a Default Theme

![Screenshot showing how to set a default theme in Weavely AI](/images/Screenshot2025-12-23at10.23.20.webp)

Once you've created themes, you can set which one is applied automatically to new forms:

1. Go to **Themes** in your dashboard
2. Find the theme you want to use as default
3. Click **Set as default**

Now every new form you create will automatically use this styling.

### Applying Themes to Forms

When creating or editing a form:

1. Open the styling panel
2. Look for the **Templates** section
3. Select any of your saved themes

The theme will be applied instantly to your form.

## Collaboration Notes

<Info>
  All team members have access to account-wide themes. Any theme created by one team member can be used by others in the same workspace.
</Info>

## Best Practices

- **Use themes for consistency** - If you're creating multiple forms for the same brand, set up a theme once and reuse it
- **Test on different devices** - Preview your styled forms on both desktop and mobile to ensure they look good everywhere
- **Keep logos readable** - Make sure your logo size is appropriate for the form layout you've chosen
- **Brand import works best with official domains** - For accurate brand styling, use the company's main website URL
