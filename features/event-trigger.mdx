Weavely makes it easy to define what happens after someone submits your form. Whether you want the form to reset for the next respondent (like in a kiosk setup) or redirect users to a specific URL (such as a thank-you page or your website), you can configure this using **Event Triggers** in the Logic tab.

This guide walks you through both options.

## Reloading the Form After Submission

This is useful for public kiosks, feedback stations, or in-person setups where the form should reset automatically for the next user.

### Steps:

1. Open your form in the editor.
2. Navigate to the **Logic** tab at the top.
3. Scroll down to **Event Triggers** and click **\+ Create Event Trigger**.
4. In the first dropdown ("When..."), select `Form is submitted`.
5. In the second dropdown ("Then..."), choose `Restart form`.
6. Click **Create Event Trigger** and **Publish**.

Now, when someone submits the form, it will reload to its initial state immediately.

## Redirecting to a URL After Submission

You can also send respondents to another page—perfect for thank-you messages, next steps, or even special offers.

### Steps:

1. Head to the **Logic** tab of your form.
2. Under **Event Triggers**, create a new trigger.
3. Set the trigger condition to `Form is submitted`.
4. Choose the action `Open URL`.
5. Enter the destination URL (e.g. `https://yourdomain.com/thank-you`).
6. Select whether the redirect should happen in the same tab or a new one.
7. Click **Create Event Trigger** and **Publish**.

When users complete the form, they'll be redirected automatically to the URL you provided.

## Other Events

Any of the two aforementioned actions can also be triggered whenever:

- The form is loaded
- A specific page in the form is shown
