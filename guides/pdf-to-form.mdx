If you’ve ever struggled to turn a dense PDF questionnaire or research doc into a clean, shareable online form, this guide is for you. With Weavely’s AI-powered form builder, you can upload a PDF and go from static content to fully interactive form in just a few clicks.

This is more than just automation. It’s a smoother way to collect, analyze, and act on data. Below, we’ll walk through how to extract questions from a PDF, style your form to match your brand, and set up automations that send your responses exactly where they need to go.

## Start with a Real PDF

Let’s say you’ve got a research survey or customer intake form, something already structured in a PDF, but not fillable or easy to distribute. For example, we'll be using the PDF shown below in this guide:

![Test Form Pn](/images/test-form.png)

Weavely is able to automatically convert this pdf into a fillable form. Upon creating a new form, upload the pdf and let our AI do its magic.

![Pdf To Form1 Gi](/images/pdf-to-form1.gif)

Optionally, you can also provide a prompt to further tweak the result. For example:

```
Seperate categories in the document across diferent pages in the form. 
```

Weavely will scan the document, extract the questions (including types like multiple choice, rating scales, or open-ended and even file uploads), and generate a fully working form. No manual copy-pasting required\!

## Review and Refine

Once your form is generated, you can:

- **Scroll through and review** the AI’s output
- **Delete or edit questions** you don’t need
- **Add new ones** with a mini prompt like:

  ```
  Add a Likert scale question about trust in the brand.
  ```

Everything stays editable—even after publishing.

## Instantly Match Your Brand

You don’t need to know CSS or fiddle with color codes.

Just:

1. Take a screenshot of your existing website, pitch deck, or logo.
2. Go to **Theme → From Screenshot**.
3. Upload the image, and Weavely will auto-match:
   - Your color palette
   - Fonts (via Google Fonts)
   - Button styles and layout spacing

## Set Up Email Notifications

Want to be notified when someone submits a response—or send them a receipt?

In the **Integrations → Email Notifications** tab:

- Add your email (or use `{{email}}` to message the respondent)
- Customize the subject and body with answer piping like:

  ```
  Subject: New response from {{full_name}}
  Body: They rated brand trust as {{brand_trust}} out of 5.
  ```

📸 **Screenshot Suggestion:**\
_The email notification setup panel with dynamic fields being added._\
**Caption:** “Personalize your email notifications with answers from the form.”

## Pipe Responses into Google Sheets

For better analysis or collaboration, you can connect your form to Google Sheets.

- Go to **Integrations → Google Sheets**
- Connect your Google account
- Select or create a sheet
- Map each form question to a column

Every new submission will show up as a new row—automatically.

📸 **Screenshot Suggestion:**\

## Share Your Form

When you're ready:

- Hit **Open Preview** to test the full experience
- Press **Share** to get a public link or embed code
- Optionally, set up the form as a **popup** on your site or a **standalone page**

📸 **Screenshot Suggestion:**\

**Caption:** “Preview and share your form instantly.”

## Why This Flow Works

Turning PDFs into fillable forms used to mean:

- Manually rewriting questions
- Reformatting them for every channel
- Hand-styling the form
- Wasting time on email follow-ups and data exports

With Weavely, you:

- Reuse existing content
- Let AI handle structure
- Match your look instantly
- Automate everything post-submit

Whether you’re a researcher, a startup, or a policy team—this workflow gets your form live, on-brand, and connected to your stack in minutes.
