If you’ve ever struggled to turn a dense PDF questionnaire or research doc into a clean, shareable online form, this guide is for you. With Weavely’s AI-powered form builder, you can upload a PDF and go from static content to fully interactive form in just a few clicks.

This is more than just automation. It’s a smoother way to collect, analyze, and act on data. Below, we’ll walk through how to extract questions from a PDF, style your form to match your brand, and set up automations that send your responses exactly where they need to go.

## Start with a Real PDF

Let’s say you’ve got a research survey or customer intake form, something already structured in a PDF, but not fillable or easy to distribute. For example, we'll be using the PDF shown below in this guide:

![Example pdf which will be turned into a fillable form with Weavely AI](/images/test-form.png)

Weavely is able to automatically convert this pdf into a fillable form. Upon creating a new form, upload the pdf and let our AI do its magic.

Optionally, you can also provide a prompt to further tweak the result. For example:

```
Seperate categories in the document across diferent pages in the form. 
```

Weavely will scan the document, extract the questions (including types like multiple choice, rating scales, or open-ended and even file uploads), and generate a fully working form. No manual copy-pasting required!

## Instantly Match Your Brand

You don’t need to know CSS or fiddle with color codes. You can also leverage our AI to automatically adapt your forms to the style you need. You can either provide stylistic instructions via a prompt, or upload an example image.

Weavely will auto-match:

- Your color palette
- Fonts (via Google Fonts)

## Review and Refine Manually (Optional)

We're not at the point where AI can do everything (yet). Sometimes you still want to add that human touch to your form or survey. Once AI has turned your pdf into a fillable form you can continue in our form editor to:

- Add additional questions or pages.
- Fine-tune the look and feel (e.g. roundings, accent colours, fonts, etc.).
- Add answer piping or skip-page logic.
- Create integrations (e.g. with Mailchimp, Google Sheets or others).

Everything stays editable, even after publishing!

## Set Up Email Notifications

Want to be notified when someone submits a response, or send them a receipt?

In the **Integrations → Email** tab:

- Add your email (or use "@" to select the form field with your respondent's address)
- Customize the subject and body with answer piping like:

  ```
  Subject: New response from @[name]
  Body: They rated brand trust as @[brand_trust] out of 5.
  ```

## Send Responses to Google Sheets

For better analysis or collaboration, you can connect your form to Google Sheets.

- Go to **Integrations → Google Sheets**
- Connect your Google account
- Map each form question to a column

Every new submission will show up as a new row, automatically.

## Share Your Form

When you're ready:

- Hit **Preview** to test the full experience.
- Go to the \*\*Share \*\*tab to get a link to your form (don't forget to hit the publish button first).
- Optionally, set up the form as a **popup** on your site or a \*\*standalone page \*\*(see tutorial video).

## Why This Flow Works

Turning PDFs into fillable forms used to mean:

- Manually rewriting questions
- Reformatting them for every channel
- Hand-styling the form
- Wasting time on email follow-ups and data exports

With Weavely, you:

- Reuse existing content
- Let AI handle conversion to a fillable form
- Match your look instantly
- Automate everything post-submit

Whether you’re a researcher, a startup, or a policy team, this workflow gets your form live, on-brand, and connected to your stack in minutes.
