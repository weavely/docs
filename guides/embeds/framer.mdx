This guide will walk you through using the **Weavely.ai** plugin to add forms to your site, generate new forms using AI, and adjust everything to match your site’s style.

---

## 🔌 Step 1: Add the Weavely Plugin in Framer

Open your Framer project and search for the **Weavely** plugin in the plugin menu. You can add it to any existing project (like the popular _Pearl_ template) or a new one.

Once installed, the plugin will ask for a **form URL**. This is where you paste the URL of any published Weavely form. You can:

- Paste an example form URL to preview functionality.
- Or paste the URL of a custom form you’ve created in Weavely.

When added, the form will render directly on your Framer canvas — ready to publish.

## 🤖 Step 2: Create a Custom AI Form in Weavely

To create a custom form, head over to [weavely.ai](https://www.weavely.ai) and click the “Start for Free” button.

Inside the editor:

- On the left, you’ll see a chat-style interface to generate forms with AI.
- On the right, you’ll see the form being built in real-time.

You can:

- Describe your form in plain language (e.g., “I need a contact form for my web agency. Make it somewhat funny.”)
- Let the AI generate questions, pages, and even a visual theme.
- Manually tweak questions, reorder elements, or change logic and design.

Once you're satisfied:

1. Add a final screen or ending (e.g., "Thank you for your submission").
2. Hit **Publish** to get your shareable form URL.

## 🔁 Step 3: Embed the Form Back into Framer

Return to Framer and paste the published form’s URL into the Weavely plugin. The form will appear on the canvas.

You can then:

- Delete any old placeholders or previous forms.
- Adjust the width and height settings so the form fits your layout (e.g., make it full-width for responsive design).
- Publish your Framer site — the form is now live and interactive.

## 📈 What Happens After Users Submit?

Once embedded, Weavely handles all form logic and data collection. You can:

- View **responses and analytics** directly inside Weavely.
- **Integrate** with tools like Google Sheets, HelpScout, or get email notifications.
- Apply **conditional logic**, customize design, or edit questions anytime.

For more advanced features, check out our integration and logic tutorials linked in the footer of this guide.

## 💡 Summary

- Use the **Weavely Framer plugin** to embed AI-generated forms with just a URL.
- Create smart forms with conditional logic and themes using Weavely’s AI builder.
- Fully customize, style, and publish forms without writing code.

Whether you're running a portfolio, landing page, or agency site, this integration makes it easy to turn form ideas into functional, styled components — all inside Framer.
