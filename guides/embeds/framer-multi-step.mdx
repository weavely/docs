<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Create a Weavely Form" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" titleSize="h2">
    To create a custom form, head over to [weavely.ai](https://www.weavely.ai) and click the “Start for Free” button.

    Inside the editor:

    - On the left, you’ll see a chat-style interface to generate forms with AI.
    - On the right, you’ll see the form being built in real-time.

    You can:

    - Describe your form in plain language (e.g., “I need a contact form for my web agency. Make it somewhat funny.”). The AI will generate questions, pages, and even a visual theme.
    - Ask the AI to tweak questions, reorder elements or add pages.
    - Ask the AI to change the design of the form.

    Of course you can also access all of this functionality outside of the AI editor by toggling "manual mode" in the top bar.

    This step might be redundant, depending on how you prompted AI in the first step. In case your form is single page or in case you want to move some questions around you can continue chatting to our AI to have your form just right. For example:

    > Seperate this form into X distinct pages, make sure that relevant questions are grouped together on the same page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Publish your Form" icon="globe" titleSize="h2">
    Once you're satisfied with your form, go ahead and press the big blue _"Publish"_ button at the top right of the screen. Don't forget to copy the form's URL, you'll need it in the next step 😉

    Once opened, the plugin will ask for a **form URL**. This is where you paste the URL of any published Weavely form. When added, press "Add to Canvas" and the form will render directly on your Framer canvas ... ready to publish!
