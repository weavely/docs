Want to add smarter forms to your Framer site? In this guide, we’ll walk through how to use [Weavely.ai](https://www.weavely.ai), an AI-native form builder, to create a form with conditional logic (e.g. showing and hiding form elements, skipping pages, etc.) and embed it in your Framer project using the official Weavely AI Forms plugin.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Create a Weavely Form" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" titleSize="h2">
    To create a custom form, head over to [weavely.ai](https://www.weavely.ai) and click the “Start for Free” button.

    Inside the editor:

    - On the left, you’ll see a chat-style interface to generate forms with AI.
    - On the right, you’ll see the form being built in real-time.

    ![Screenshot showing how to generate forms and surveys using AI in weavely](/images/Screenshot2025-11-20at11.52.41.png)

    You can:

    - Describe your form in plain language (e.g., “I need a contact form for my web agency. Make it somewhat funny.”). The AI will generate questions, pages, and even a visual theme.
    - Ask the AI to tweak questions, reorder elements or add pages.
    - Ask the AI to change the design of the form.

    Of course you can also access all of this functionality outside of the AI editor by toggling "manual mode" in the top bar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Ask AI to Add Conditional Logic" icon="robot" titleSize="h2">
    Similarly to building your form, you can add conditional logic simply by prompting the AI to do so in the chat. For example:

    > Only make question X visible if the user has typed an answer for question Y.

    Or even

    > Skip page 2 if the user has responded "No" to question X on page 1.

    You can also manually add these conditional logic rules or tweak the ones generated by AI. [Here's a short tutorial on how to do this](/features/skip-logic).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Publish your Form" icon="globe" titleSize="h2">
    Once you're satisfied with your form, go ahead and press the big blue _"Publish"_ button at the top right of the screen. Don't forget to copy the form's URL, you'll need it in the next step 😉

  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4: Embed in Framer" icon="plug" titleSize="h2">
    Open your Framer project and search for the **Weavely** plugin in the plugin menu.

    ![Screenshot showing how to find the Weavely AI Forms plugin in Framer](/images/Screenshot2025-11-20at11.25.22.webp)

    Once opened, the plugin will ask for a **form URL**. This is where you paste the URL of any published Weavely form. When added, press "Add to Canvas" and the form will render directly on your Framer canvas ... ready to publish!
