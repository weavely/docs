<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Form in Weavely" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" titleSize="h2">
    Build your form using Weavely. You can use the AI prompt or build manually.

    > Example: A contact form collecting name, email, phone number, and company.

    Make sure your form includes an email field if you want to email the response to the user. For a quick overview of how Weavely works, check out our ["getting started" tutorial](https://help.weavely.ai/get-started/the-basics).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Google Docs Template" icon="file-doc" titleSize="h2">
    In Google Docs, create a template for the PDF. Use **double curly braces** to define placeholders for dynamic values, as follows:

    ```
    Date: {{date}}
    Name: {{full_name}}
    Email: {{email}}
    Company: {{company}}
    ```

    For example, here's the template we created for our video tutorial.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Your Scenario in Make" icon="gear" titleSize="h2">
    Create a new scenario in Make. You'll need four modules in this scenario.

    ### Module 1: Watch Weavely Form Submissions

    This module will trigger the automation when a new form response is submitted.

    - Add: `Weavely > Watch Form Submission`
    - Connect your Weavely account (follow the wizard).
    - Select the correct **team** and **form**.

    You can read our [dedicated tutorial](/integrations/make) if you need help setting up the Weavely module in Make.

    ### Module 2: Create Document from Template

    - Add: `Google Docs > Create Document from Template`
    - Connect your Google account.
    - Choose your template document from Drive.
    - Map the template placeholders to your form values:
      - `{{date}}` â†’ `Submission Date`
      - `{{full_name}}` â†’ `Full Name`
      - `{{email}}` â†’ `Email`
      - `{{company}}` â†’ `Company`
    - Set a document name (e.g., `"Contact Form Submission"`).
    - Choose the folder where the document will be saved.

    ### Module 3: Download a File

    To convert the Google doc you created with module 2 into a PDF you'll need the Google Drive "Download a File" module.

    - Add: `Google Drive > Download a File`
    - Use the document ID from the previous module.
    - Enable: `Convert Google Document to format â†’ PDF`.

    ### Module 4: Send Email with Attachment

    Finally, you'll need to send the report to someone. This could be yourself, or a respondent.

    - Add: `Gmail > Send Email` (or another mail service).
    - To: Use the respondentâ€™s email address (from the Weavely response) or your own.
    - Subject: `"Your Weavely Report"`
    - Body: Optional â€“ you can leave this blank or customize it.
    - Attachment: The PDF file from the previous module.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the Flow" icon="vial" titleSize="h2">
    1. Run your scenario.
    2. Submit the form.
    3. Check your email inbox â€“ you (or the respondent) should receive a PDF.

    The PDF will contain the form data, and any missing fields will be left blank.
  </Step>
