Capturing and managing high-quality leads efficiently can be a challenge. Especially if you're dealing with manual form creation and CRM integrations. In this guide, you'll discover how Weavely.ai lets you effortlessly create powerful, multi-page lead generation forms using AI, and seamlessly integrate those leads directly into your HubSpot CRM.

## Generating Your Lead Generation Form with AI

Start by clearly describing the lead generation form you need. With Weavely.ai, you can either type your description, speak directly to the AI, or even upload supporting documents.

Here's an example prompt from our tutorial:

```
I need a lead generation tool for an AI form builder. I want to know what kind of form builder people are using todayâ€”use a dropdown populated with the top players in the field. I'm also interested in what they currently lack as functionality in their current tools. Also, ask any other questions that you think are relevant for a lead generation form. I want it spread across multiple pages.
```

Weavely instantly generates a structured form that includes:

- A dropdown pre-filled with top form builders currently used.
- Questions about missing functionality.
- Additional qualifying questions (e.g., other tools used).
- Essential contact fields like name, email, and company name.

## Customize Your Form (Optional)

Once the AI-generated form is ready, you can enter the manual editor to further customize it:

- Adjust form questions and page structure.
- Apply your branding (fonts, colors, styles).
- Set up advanced logic to skip or show questions conditionally.

Although powerful, customization is optionalâ€”Weavely.aiâ€™s generated forms are ready-to-use immediately.
