  <Step title="Build Your AI Form in Weavely" icon="hammer">
    To start, head to [Weavely.ai](https://weavely.ai) and generate your form using a natural-language prompt like:

    > ‚ÄúI need a lead generation form for my agency website. It should qualify potential projects.‚Äù

    Weavely will create a form with relevant questions automatically: project name, service interest, budget, timing, and more.

    You can:

    - Edit any question manually
    - Add more fields or pages
    - Customize the design (fonts, colors, borders, button style)
    - Use Weavely‚Äôs AI styling based on your brand or website design

    Once your form looks the way you want:

    1. Click **Publish**.
    2. Go to the **Share** tab.
    3. Copy the standalone **form URL** (not embed code, just the plain URL).

    You can test it in a new tab to confirm it loads the full form page. But trust us, it does üòâ

## Optimizing Layout for Desktop & Mobile

Google Sites preserves the aspect ratio of your embedded form, which can cause layout issues. Especially on mobile!

### Common Issues:

- **Scrollbars on desktop** if the form is too tall.
- **Tiny, squished forms on mobile** if the aspect ratio isn‚Äôt mobile-optimized.

### Workaround:

- Resize the embed container manually by dragging the edges.
- For **mobile**: Make the embed container **narrower and taller**.
- For **desktop**: Fill horizontal space by placing an **image** next to the form.

For example, this is how we tackled the issue in our example video:

It‚Äôs a balancing act, but with a bit of tweaking, you can get a good result on both devices.

## Summary

You now have a beautifully styled, fully functional form built with Weavely‚Äôs AI, embedded directly in your Google Site with no coding required. While Google Sites has a few layout quirks, with the right tweaks your form will look great and capture leads effectively.
