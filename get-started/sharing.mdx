Weavely makes it easy to share your form so you can quickly start gathering responses. Here's how you can get your form out into the world.

## Option 1: Share a Standalone Form (Hosted by Weavely)

Each form you create is automatically hosted as its own standalone webpage on Weavelyâ€™s secure servers. Simply share the provided public link to start collecting responses immediately.

You can customize your formâ€™s appearance on social media by setting a **Form Name**, **Form Icon**, and a **Social Media Description**. This helps give your form a branded, professional look.
