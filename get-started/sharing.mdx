Weavely makes it easy to share your form so you can quickly start gathering responses. Here's how you can get your form out into the world.

## Option 1: Share a Standalone Form (Hosted by Weavely)

Each form you create is automatically hosted as its own standalone webpage on Weavely’s secure servers. Simply share the provided public link to start collecting responses immediately.

You can customize your form’s appearance on social media by setting a **Form Name**, **Form Icon**, and a **Social Media Description**. This helps give your form a branded, professional look.

<Info>
  Customizing your form's sharing appearance is a Weavely pro feature.

## Option 2: Embed Form into Your Website

Embed your form directly onto your existing website to blend seamlessly with your page content.Alternatively, you can also set your form to appear as a popup based on various triggers. We've dedicated an entire help desk article on this subject.
