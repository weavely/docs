This article distills the key moves from our “Quick Guide” video into a written walkthrough.  

Follow along once and you’ll be spinning up branded, multi-page forms on autopilot.

## Step 1: Prompt to Generate a Form

You generate forms in Weavely by leaving a prompt which specifies what your form is about. Optionally you can also speak to our AI by holding the microphone button in the bottom right corner of the prompt area. 

Besides giving our AI the context it needs in text format you can also upload .pdf, .png or .jpg files with additional information. Here are some examples you can get started with:

- A document with draft questions
- A pitch deck of your product
- A document containing customer information

## Step 2: Drop in Extra Questions on Demand

Mid-build and remember something you need to add? Simply click _Add Content_ in the left panel and choose _"Create with AI"_. Type a short prompt to explain what you want to add, for example:

> “Add a willingness-to-pay scale question.”

The question(s) appear(s) in the right format\!

## Step 3: Style your Form with AI

By default your form will be generated in one of Weavely's built-in themes. You can either manually restyle your form using the right panel or let AI restyle your form by pressing _Change Theme_ at the top of the right panel. 

You can specify the desired style with a prompt or by uploading a screenshot. In the latter case our AI will match the colour styles and font (if detected).
