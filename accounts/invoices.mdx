When you upgrade your Weavely subscription, you won't automatically receive invoices by email from us. However, you can easily access invoices for all your payments inside our platform.

Inside the dashboard navigate to **Settings → Team Settings** and click the "_Billing & Invoices_" button. You'll be redirected to a Stripe portal which contains all your details.
