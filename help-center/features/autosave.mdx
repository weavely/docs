The autosave feature lets your respondents save their form responses automatically so they can leave and come back to continue filling out your form later. Their answers are stored in their browser's local storage, so they won't lose their progress.

To enable autosave responses, open your form and navigate to the **Settings** section, in the **General** sub-section. Toggle on the "_Autosave progress_" option.

When enabled, respondents can close the form at any time and their responses will be saved. When they return to the same form URL, their progress will be automatically restored so they can pick up where they left off.

**Note:** Responses are saved locally in the respondent's browser. If they clear their browser data or switch to a different device, their saved progress will not be available.
