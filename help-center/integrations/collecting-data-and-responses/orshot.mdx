The Orshot integration lets you automatically generate PDF documents from form submissions. When someone completes your form, their responses are sent to Orshot to create a personalized PDF based on your template. This works for certificates, tickets, receipts, and any custom document you need.

## Setting Up Orshot in Your Weavely Form

First, you'll need an Orshot account with a PDF template ready. In your Orshot account, go to **API Keys** and copy your API key.

## Mapping Form Fields to Your PDF Template

Once connected, select which Orshot template you want to use from the dropdown menu.

For each field in your Orshot template, you'll see a mapping field where you can specify what data to include. Click the **@** symbol to select form fields, or type literal text directly.

You can read more about mapping form fields in [this tutorial](/help-center/integrations/data-mapping).

Click **Create Integration** and republish your form. PDFs will now generate automatically for each new submission.

## Viewing Your Generated PDFs

After a form is submitted, the generated PDF appears in your Orshot account. Go to your certificate template and click **Renders** to see all generated PDFs.
