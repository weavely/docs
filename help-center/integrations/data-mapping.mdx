Weavely's mapping functionality allows you to automatically send form submission data to various third-party tools like Notion, HubSpot, Salesforce, and more. This guide will show you how to map form fields to your integration destinations.

## Understanding Field Mapping

When you set up an integration, each column or field in your destination (e.g., a Notion database) will appear as a mappable field in Weavely. You can populate these fields in three ways:

1. **Static text** - Enter literal text that will be the same for every submission
2. **Form field data** - Pull dynamic data from form submissions using the `@` symbol
3. **Combined values** - Mix static text with form field data

## Step 1: Set Up Your Integration

Navigate to the **Integrations** section of your form and select the third-party tool you want to connect (e.g., Notion, HubSpot, Salesforce).

Once connected, select the specific database or destination where you want your form data to be sent. Weavely will then display all available fields from that destination.

## Step 2: Map Your Fields

For each field in your integration, you have several options:

### Option 1: Leave It Empty

If a field is optional in your destination system, you can leave it blank.

### Option 2: Enter Static Text

Type any text directly into the field. For example, you could always set a status field to `"New Lead"` for every submission.

### Option 3: Use Form Field Data

To insert dynamic data from your form:

1. Type the `@` symbol
2. Select the form field you want to use from the dropdown menu
3. The field reference will appear in the mapping

**Example:** For a "Name" field in Notion, you could select `@First Name` to populate it with the first name from each form submission.

### Option 4: Combine Text and Form Fields

You can mix static text with form field data to create custom formatting.

**Example:** To create a full name field formatted as "First / Last":

- Type `@` and select `First Name`
- Type `/` (or any separator you prefer)
- Type `@` again and select `Last Name`

This will result in entries like "John / Doe" in your destination system.

## Step 3: Save Your Integration & Test it

Once you've mapped all required fields, click **Create Integration. **Submit a test entry through your form to verify that:

- Data appears in your destination system correctly
- Field mappings are working as expected
- Any combined fields display the formatting you want
