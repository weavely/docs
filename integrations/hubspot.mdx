## Step 2: Link Your Hubspot Account

Is this the first time you set up a Hubspot integration? Then Weavely will first guide you through the steps to connect your Hubspot account to Weavely. Just press _"Connect to Hubspot"_ to get started.

## Step 3: Map Form Fields to Contact Properties

Once you've connected your Salesforce account you'll be able to set up the integration for your form. In a first step you'll need to select which Salesforce object you want to create upon form submission. In a second step you can specify how fields of your form correspond to properties of your Salesforce object. The gif below showcases both these steps.
