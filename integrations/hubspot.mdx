## Step 2: Link Your Hubspot Account

Is this the first time you set up a Hubspot integration? Then Weavely will first guide you through the steps to connect your Hubspot account to Weavely. Just press _"Connect to Hubspot"_ to get started.

## Step 3: Map Form Fields to Contact Properties

Once you've connected your Hubspot account you'll be able to set up the integration for your form. You can specify which fields of your form should be used to create the new contact in Hubspot as shown in the gif below. At the time of writing you can only create new contacts after a form submission. Looking to do something else?
