## Step 1: Open the Integrations Tab

With the editor open, navigate to the _Integrations_ tab and select the _Google Sheets_ integration as shown below.

## Step 2: Link Your Google Account

Is this the first time you set up a Google Sheets integration? Then Weavely will first guide you through the steps to connect your Google account to Weavely. Just press _"Connect to Google Sheets"_ to get started.

The next steps are self explanatory, you've probably used them before if you've ever connected a Google account to something. Make sure to give Weavely the rights it needs by checking the permissions checkbox though:

## Step 3: Select Form Fields

By default Weavely will create a new Google Sheet for you which has a column for every form field in your form. You can also choose to only import a selection of form fields into your Google Sheet using the checkboxes.
