## Step 1: Open the Integrations Tab

With the editor open, navigate to the _Integrations_ tab and select the _Google Sheets_ integration as shown below.

## Step 2: Link Your Google Account

Is this the first time you set up a Google Sheets integration? Then Weavely will first guide you through the steps to connect your Google account to Weavely. Just press _"Connect to Google Sheets"_ to get started.

The next steps are self explanatory, you've probably used them before if you've ever connected a Google account to something. Make sure to give Weavely the rights it needs by checking the permissions checkbox though:

## Step 3: Select Form Fields

By default Weavely will create a new Google Sheet for you which has a column for every form field in your form. You can also choose to only import a selection of form fields into your Google Sheet using the checkboxes.

<Warning>
  Changes you make to your form will not automatically update the Google Sheet you created in the previous steps. In case you need to change your form after you've setup the integration we suggest you delete the integration and create a new one.
</Warning>

## **Changing Your Google Sheets Account or Resetting Your Connection**

If you ever need to reset your connection with Google Sheets, for instance to switch to a different account or reauthorize access, you can do so from your Weavely dashboard. Go to **Settings → Connected Accounts** and click the red **“Disconnect”** button next to Google Sheets. You can then reconnect with the correct account.
