With Weavely's **Email Notifications** integration, you can trigger emails instantly, personalize their content using answers from the form, and include dynamic info like submission timestamps or scores.

<Tip>
  You can add as many email notifications as you want.
</Tip>

## Step 1: Turn on the Email Integration

Within your form's editor, navigate to the _Integrations_ tab and press _\+Add_ in the _Email_ card

## Step 2: Setting the Email's Content

You can configure three elements of an email notification:

1. **To:** the recipient of your email notification (at the time of writing this can only be a single email address).
2. **Subject:** the subject of the email.
3. **Content:** the email notification's actual content.

For all three of these elements, you can either type in text or insert values from the form's responses (i.e. answer piping). Start by typing "@" and a dropdown will appear with form elements you can insert. For the "_To"_ part of your email you can only insert values from email form elements. The gif below shows how this works.
