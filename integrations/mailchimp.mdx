In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to connect a Weavely form to a Mailchimp list.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Integrations Tab">
    Start by opening the form you want to connect in the Weavely editor. Head over to the **Integrations** tab, where you’ll see **Mailchimp** listed among the available integrations. Click **Add**.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Your Mailchimp Account">
    Next, you’ll be prompted to authorize the connection between your Weavely and Mailchimp accounts. Click the **Connect** button, which will redirect you to Mailchimp's login page. After logging in, Mailchimp will ask whether you trust the application, go ahead and approve the authorization by clicking **Allow**. Once complete, you’ll be redirected back into Weavely, and your accounts will now be linked.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose the List and Email Field">
    With your Mailchimp account connected, you can now configure the integration by selecting which Mailchimp list should receive the new email addresses. If you only have one list, this step is straightforward. You’ll also be asked to select the appropriate email field from your form. This is particularly useful if your form contains multiple email inputs, as it ensures the correct one is used to create the contact in Mailchimp. Once you've made your selections, press **Create Integration** to finalize the setup.
