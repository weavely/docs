Weavely's MCP Server allows AI clients like **Claude**, **Cursor**, or others to integrate directly with Weavely’s form-generation API—using standard [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) tools.

This guide walks you through what the Weavely MCP is, how it works, and how to configure it for any compatible AI agent.

## What is an MCP Server?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard that allows AI models to **call tools**—like APIs or custom functions—by passing structured arguments.

Instead of hardcoding every integration, you provide a reference to an MCP server that **exposes tools dynamically**. The LLM then learns what tools are available and when to use them, all without manual plumbing.

## What Can You Do with Weavely MCP?

The **Weavely MCP server** currently exposes a `create-form` tool that lets your AI client instantly generate sophisticated, production-grade forms from a user prompt.

For example:

> “Create a post-purchase NPS survey for new customers using behavioral science principles.”

Behind the scenes, the MCP tool calls:

```
POST https://api.weavely.ai/v1/forms/generate
```

and returns the url of the generated form.

## Basic Setup

Here’s a sample configuration you can drop into your `mcp.json` or equivalent config file for any compatible AI client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weavely-mcp-http": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote-http",
        "https://mcp.weavely.ai/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This will load the tools served by `https://mcp.weavely.ai/mcp` via the `mcp-remote-http` runner.

**Note**: `npx` should be available in your terminal. If you're on Windows and using a local agent, you may need to prefix commands with `cmd /c`.

## Tools

`create-form`

This MCP server currently exposes one tool:

| Name          | Description                           | Inputs                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `create-form` | Create a new Weavely form from prompt | `prompt` (required), `name` (optional) |

## How It Works

Once loaded, the LLM sees `create-form` as a callable action and can invoke it whenever relevant in conversation.

**Example usage in Claude or Cursor**:

> “Create a bug reporting form for engineering users with required fields for steps to reproduce.”

The LLM will detect this intent, call the `create-form` tool, and return a full JSON definition of the form.
