If you're looking to upgrade your existing Google Forms with better design, advanced logic, and powerful integrations—Weavely makes it effortless. In this guide, we’ll show you how to import a Google Form into Weavely and enhance it with styling, smart logic, and third-party tools.

### Step 1: Start with Weavely

Head to [weavely.ai](https://weavely.ai) and click the **Start Building for Free** button. On the start screen, look to the right-hand side and select **Connect to Google Forms**.

### Step 2: Connect Your Google Account

You’ll be guided through a simple single sign-on process using your Google account. This is similar to how you’ve probably connected other tools before. Just follow the prompts to authorize access.

### Step 3: Paste Your Google Forms Editor URL

Once connected, you’ll be asked to provide a link to the form you want to import. **Make sure you copy the Google Form’s editor URL**—this is the one you use when editing the form, not the shareable URL you send to others. The editor URL typically ends with `/edit`. Paste that into the input field and click **Import**.

### Step 4: Review and Style Your Form

Weavely will automatically extract all questions from your Google Form and recreate them inside its own interface. From here, you can:

- Apply any of Weavely’s ready-made themes to improve visual design.
- Upload a document (like your brand guide) or describe the desired look in a prompt to style it using AI.

### Step 5: Customize Further in the Editor

After styling, continue to the Weavely editor to fine-tune your form. You can:

- Add new questions or modify existing ones.
- Adjust layout, fonts, and color schemes.
- Set up conditional logic to show or hide questions based on previous answers.
- Integrate with third-party tools like HubSpot, Slack, Google Sheets, and more.
