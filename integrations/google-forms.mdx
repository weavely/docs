Weavely makes it effortless to upgrade your existing Google Forms with better design, advanced logic, and powerful integrations. In this guide, we’ll show you how to import a Google Form into Weavely and enhance it with styling, smart logic, and third-party tools.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Create a New Weavely Form" titleSize="h2">
    To import your Google Form, create a new Weavely form. In the AI conversation panel click on "_Import a form_".

  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Connect Your Google Account" titleSize="h2">
    Before Weavely can import your Google Form, you'll first need to grant us the right access. Don't worry, it's a simple single sign-on process that you start by pressing _"Connect to Google Forms"_ in the _"Import"_ modal.

    <Warning>
      Make sure to connect the Google account which you used to create the form you want to import.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Paste your Google Form Edit Link" titleSize="h2">
    Once connected, you’ll be asked to provide a link to the form you want to import. Make sure you copy the Google Form’s editor URL. This is the one you use when editing the form, not the shareable URL you send to others. The editor URL typically ends with **/edit**. Paste that into the input field and click Import. For example:

    ```html
    https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_s3nDl4TpXRBfWGbaZcZ4iHbgsGX1nvZqltI35aKuBU/edit
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## **Changing Your Google Forms Account or Resetting Your Connection**

If you ever need to reset your connection with Google Forms, for instance to switch to a different account or reauthorize access, you can do so from your Weavely dashboard. Go to **Settings → Connected Accounts** and click the red **“Disconnect”** button next to Google Forms. You can then reconnect with the correct account.
