Looking to build forms and surveys in ChatGPT? We've built a custom GPT for exactly that use case. In this short tutorial you'll learn how to get started.

## Step 1: Finding our Custom GPT "Weavely Forms & Surveys"

You can search for our custom GPT in the _"Explore GPTs"_ section of ChatGPT (see screenshot below). Alternatively, here's a [direct link](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6808eedcf1bc8191a47e3c46b2bda4df-weavely-forms-surveys) to it\!

Once you've found our custom GPT simply press the "Start Chat" button at the bottom of the custom GPT card.

## Step 2: Chat and Iterate on Your Form or Survey

This part probably needs the least explaining. Simply chat to our custom GPT like you would with ChatGPT. Brainstorm questions to ask, phrasing, types of questions to use, etc. You can essentially leverage the power of ChatGPT to fine tune all content-related aspects of your form or survey\!

Once you are satisfied with the outline of your form you can ask ChatGPT to go ahead and generate the Weavely form for you. It will then proceed by asking you whether you trust Weavely.ai. If that's the case (which we hope sincerely) then simply press \_"Confirm". \_

ChatGPT will subsequently send over the questions and question types used in your form to our API. Once the form is generated you'll receive the link to it inside of your conversation.

## Step 3: Fine-tuning your Form's Design and Publishing

Clicking the link in the previous step will lead you straight to the Weavely.ai editor. You can use the editor to further refine the look and feel of your form, set up integrations, add conditional logic (e.g. skipping certain questions) or even change your form's social media preview and favicon. Whenever you're satisfied with the result you can go ahead and hit the "_Publish"_ button (top right). This step will require you to have a Weavely.ai account, but don't worry it's free to create one\!
