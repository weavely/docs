We're constantly adding native integrations to third-party tools. However, we can't integrate them all\! If there's a tool you want to connect your Weavely form to, chances are it's already available on Zapier. Here's how to use Weavely in combination with Zapier.

<Steps>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Personal Token">
    You'll need something called a _"personal token"_ to connect you Weavely account to Zapier. To create this token, navigate to _Settings-\>Personal Tokens_ in the dashboard. Once created you'll be able to copy and paste this token (i.e. a string of text) to Zapier in step x.

  <Step title="Create a Weavely Trigger in Zapier">
    Open the form you want to include in your Zapier workflow in the Weavely dashboard. Navigate to the _Integrations_ tab and hit the _"\+ Add" _button next to Zapier. This will automatically create a Zapier trigger for you for that form. This trigger will fire everytime a new submission is received for that form. 

    <Info>
      Alternatively, you can also start this step from within Zapier. Just search for Weavely when creating the trigger and you'll be able to select which form you want to include in your Zapier automation through a dropdown.
