## Step 2: Link Your Notion Account

Is this the first time you set up a Notion integration? Then Weavely will first guide you through the steps to connect your Notion account to Weavely. Just press _"Connect to Notion"_ to get started.

## Step 3: Map Form Fields to Database Properties

Once you've connected your Notion account you'll be able to set up the integration for your form. In a first step you'll need to select which Notion database you want the responses to go to. In a second step you can specify how fields of your form correspond to columns of your Notion database. The gif below showcases both these steps.

<Info>
  If you can't see your Notion database you might not have given Weavely permissions to the right workspace or pages within your Notion. You can repeat the process in step 2 by disconnecting your Notion account in the Weavely dashboard under _Settings -\> Connected Accounts_

## **Changing Your Notion Account or Resetting Your Connection**

If you ever need to reset your connection with Notion, for instance to switch to a different account or reauthorize access, you can do so from your Weavely dashboard. Go to **Settings → Connected Accounts** and click the red **“Disconnect”** button next to Notion. You can then reconnect with the correct account.
