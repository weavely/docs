  <Step title="Link Your Zoho Account">
    Is this the first time you set up a Zoho integration? Then Weavely will first guide you through the steps to connect your Zoho account to Weavely. Just press _"Connect to Zoho"_ to get started.

  <Step title="Map Form Fields to Contact Properties">
    Once you've connected your Zoho account you'll be able to set up the integration for your form. You can specify which fields of your form should be used to create the new contact in Hubspot as shown in the gif below. At the time of writing you can only create new contacts after a form submission. Looking to do something else? Reach out to [florian@weavely.ai](mailto:florian@weavely.ai) to tell us your use case and we'll add it to the roadmap\!
