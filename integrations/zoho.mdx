  <Step title="Map Form Fields to Contact Properties">
    Once you've connected your Zoho account you'll be able to set up the integration for your form. You can specify which fields of your form should be used to create the new contact in Zoho as shown in the gif below. At the time of writing you can only create new contacts after a form submission. Looking to do something else? Reach out to [florian@weavely.ai](mailto:florian@weavely.ai) to tell us your use case and we'll add it to the roadmap!

    <Warning>
      To create a contact in Zoho you need to at least map a last name.

## **Changing Your Zoho Account or Resetting Your Connection**

If you ever need to reset your connection with Zoho, for instance to switch to a different account or reauthorize access, you can do so from your Weavely dashboard. Go to **Settings → Connected Accounts** and click the red **“Disconnect”** button next to Zoho. You can then reconnect with the correct account.
