## Step 1: Open the Integrations Tab

With the editor open, navigate to the _Integrations_ tab and select the _Airtable_ integration as shown below.

## Step 2: Link Your Airtable Account

Is this the first time you set up a Airtable integration? Then Weavely will first guide you through the steps to connect your Airtable account to Weavely. Just press _"Connect to Airtable"_ to get started.

## Step 3: Map Form Fields to Table Columns

Once you've connected your Airtable account you'll be able to set up the integration for your form. In a first step you'll need to select the base and the table in which you want to collect submissions. In a second step you can specify how fields of your form correspond to table columns. The gif below showcases both these steps.

## **Changing Your Airtable Account or Resetting Your Connection**

If you ever need to reset your connection with Airtable, for instance to switch to a different account or reauthorize access, you can do so from your Weavely dashboard. Go to **Settings → Connected Accounts** and click the red **“Disconnect”** button next to Airtable. You can then reconnect with the correct account.
