## Step 2: Link Your Airtable Account

Is this the first time you set up a Airtable integration? Then Weavely will first guide you through the steps to connect your Airtable account to Weavely. Just press _"Connect to Airtable"_ to get started.

## Step 3: Map Form Fields to Table Columns

Once you've connected your Airtable account you'll be able to set up the integration for your form. In a first step you'll need to select the base and the table in which you want to collect submissions. In a second step you can specify how fields of your form correspond to table columns. The gif below showcases both these steps.
