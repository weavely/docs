Here's how to connect Weavely and [viaSocket](https://viasocket.com/) in a few simple steps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a Personal Token in Weavely" titleSize="h2">
    You'll need something called a _"personal token"_ to connect you Weavely account to viaSocket. To create this token, navigate to _Settings-\>Personal Tokens_ in the dashboard. Once created you'll be able to copy and paste this token (i.e. a string of text) to viaSocket in step 2.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Weavely Triggers in viaSocket" titleSize="h2">
    When you create a new flow in viaSocket, search for "Weavely" to find Weavely's triggers. For the moment this is limited to "New form submissions". In other words, your flow will be activated everytime your Weavely form gathers a new submission.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup the Weavely Connection in viaSocket" titleSize="h2">
    When you open a Weavely trigger for the first time you'll first be prompted to connect your Weavely account. This is where your personal token from step 1 will come into play. Copy and paste the token into the field marked "API key" by viaSocket.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Building your Flow" titleSize="h2">
    That's it! You're all set to start using your form submissions in your viaSocket flow. Further configure the trigger by selecting the right team and the right form to power your automation!
