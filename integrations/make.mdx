Hereâ€™s how to connect your Weavely form to Make in just a few minutes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a Personal Token in Weavely">
    You'll need something called a _"personal token"_ to connect you Weavely account to Make. To create this token, navigate to _Settings-\>Personal Tokens_ in the dashboard. Once created you'll be able to copy and paste this token (i.e. a string of text) to Make in step 3.

  <Step title="Add the Make Integration to Your Form">
    To begin, open the Weavely form you want to automate and navigate to the **Integrations** tab. From there, select **Make** and click **Add**. This will open Make, where youâ€™ll be prompted to install the Weavely connection. Simply select your organization and follow the steps to complete the setup wizard.

  <Step title="Set Up the Webhook in Make">
    Start by creating a new scenario in Make. Add the **Weavely** module and choose the **Watch Form Submission** trigger. When prompted, create a new connection by pasting your personal token from Step 1. Then, select your Weavely team and specify the form you want to monitor. Once set up, your Make scenario will automatically listen for new form submissions.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Actions to Your Scenario">
    Now that Make is listening for new form data, you can add any actions you like using one of Makeâ€™s many available integrations. For example, you might choose to send a message, create a record, or trigger an automation in a third-party tool when a form is submitted.

    To personalize those actions, you can reference form responses (e.g. the respondentâ€™s name or email) using dynamic values.
  </Step>
</Steps>

And thatâ€™s it\! Youâ€™ve successfully connected Weavely to Make and automated your first workflow ðŸŽ‰
