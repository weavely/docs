Hereâ€™s how to connect your Weavely form to Make in just a few minutes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a Personal Token in Weavely">
    You'll need something called a _"personal token"_ to connect you Weavely account to Make. To create this token, navigate to _Settings-\>Personal Tokens_ in the dashboard. Once created you'll be able to copy and paste this token (i.e. a string of text) to Make in step 3.

</Steps>

## Step 2: Add the Make Integration to Your Form

1. Open the Weavely form you want to automate.
2. Go to the **Integrations** tab.
3. Click **Make** and press **Add**.
4. This opens a Make template pre-configured to trigger when your form receives a new submission.

## Step 3: Set Up the Webhook in Make

1. Inside Make, youâ€™ll be prompted to **install the Weavely connection**.
2. Select your organization and finish the wizard.
3. Create a new scenario.
4. Add the **Weavely module** and choose the **Watch Form Submission** trigger.
5. Create a new connection:
   - Paste your personal token from Step 1.
   - Select your **Weavely team** and the specific **form** to watch.

Now your Make scenario will listen for new form submissions.

## Step 4: Add Actions to Your Scenario (Example: Send a Slack Message)

Now that Make is listening for new form data, you can add any actions you want:

- Add a **Slack** module to send a DM when a form is submitted.
- Use dynamic values (like the respondentâ€™s name or message) by referencing form fields.
- You can access form fields by clicking the `+` button or typing `/` in text fields.

Example:

```
Hello from {{first_name}} via Weavely form.
```

You can do the same for Gmail, Google Sheets, or any of Makeâ€™s hundreds of integrations.

## Step 5: Test and Activate Your Scenario

1. Submit your form through Weavely.
2. Watch Make receive the data and trigger your scenario.
3. Confirm your automation works as expected (e.g., a Slack message appears).
4. Set the scenario to **run instantly** when new data arrives (not just once).

And thatâ€™s it\! Youâ€™ve successfully connected Weavely to Make and automated your first workflow. ðŸŽ‰
