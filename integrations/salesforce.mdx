## Step 1: Open the Integrations Tab

With the editor open, navigate to the _Integrations_ tab and select the _Salesforce_ integration as shown below.

## Step 2: Link Your Salesforce Account

Is this the first time you set up a Salesforce integration? Then Weavely will first guide you through the steps to connect your Salesforce account to Weavely. Just press _"Connect to Salesforce"_ to get started.

## Step 3: Map Form Fields to Object Properties

Once you've connected your Salesforce account you'll be able to set up the integration for your form. In a first step you'll need to select which Salesforce object you want to create upon form submission. In a second step you can specify how fields of your form correspond to properties of your Salesforce object. The gif below showcases both these steps.

## **Changing Your Salesforce Account or Resetting Your Connection**

If you ever need to reset your connection with Salesforce, for instance to switch to a different account or reauthorize access, you can do so from your Weavely dashboard. Go to **Settings → Connected Accounts** and click the red **“Disconnect”** button next to Salesforce. You can then reconnect with the correct account.
