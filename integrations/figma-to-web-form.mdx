The Weavely Figma plugin lets you transform static Figma designs into working, fillable web forms, all in a few clicks. Whether you're prototyping, building UX surveys, or collecting structured feedback from testers, this plugin helps you move from design to live form instantly.

## What the Plugin Does

With the plugin, you can select any Figma frames and turn them into a functioning web form powered by Weavely. It extracts both the **content** (like questions and labels) and the **visual theme** (colors, fonts, layout) from your design, then uses AI to generate a form that looks and feels like your mockup, but is fully interactive and shareable.

## How to Use the Plugin

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Plugin">
    ![Screenshot 2025-09-25 at 18.29.05.png](/images/Screenshot2025-09-25at18.29.05.png)

    You can open the plugin [here](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1255122665773297640/figma-to-web-forms). Or simply search for "Figma to web form" from within Figma.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Frames to Convert">
    ![Select Generate Gi](/images/select-generate.gif)

    Choose the frames that contain your form content. For example, in a UX survey, you might have multiple frames with radio buttons, input fields, or sliders. Once selected, hit **"Generate Form"** in the plugin panel.

    The plugin uses AI to scan the content and layout of your design and begins building a form automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview & Publish Your Form">

    You’ll get a real-time preview of your generated form inside the plugin. It’s interactive, with radio buttons, input fields, and submit actions. Just like a normal web form.

    When you're satisfied, hit **“Publish Form.”** This opens the Weavely editor where you can:

    - Refine questions or add new ones
    - Apply advanced styling or change the layout
    - Add conditional logic
    - Integrate with third-party tools like Slack, HubSpot, Zapier, etc.

    Once you’re happy with your final form, press **“Publish”** again and get a live URL to share or embed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Style Transfer from Figma

Basic theming — such as background color, accent colors, and font family — is extracted automatically. So if your Figma design has a deep red background and white buttons, your generated form will reflect that.

For advanced theming (custom layout, typography, brand assets), you can fine-tune everything from within the Weavely editor.

<Warning>
  The plugin will not take into account your custom design or layout from within Figma.
</Warning>
